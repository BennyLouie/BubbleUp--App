BUBBLE UP! 
========================

A simple web application to that allows users to review bubble tea shops and add bubble teas to their list of recommendations. 

The app is built using Rails [6.0], HTML, CSS (through Bulma as well as a custom stylesheet), and a Postgres SQL database.

Pre-seeded with Boba Tea shop data (which we found through Google) and bubble teas (based off my memory of visiting boba shops).

There is a filter feature on the index page of the boba shops which allows users to select either 'name' or 'location' to filter by and then type in the name of either the shop or its location.

This app was developed as Flatiron School's mod 2 Project.
